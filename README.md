[![Preview](https://serhiy.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Github_repo/gcloud/logo_gcp_vertical_rgb.png?v=1)](https://cloud.google.com)

GitHub Action which allows interacting with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

## Usage

To use gcloud in your workflow use:

```yaml
- uses: actions-hub/gcloud@master
  env:
    PROJECT_ID: test
    APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS }}
  with:
    args: info
```

You can also use `gsutil` from Google Cloud SDK package.

```yaml
- uses: actions-hub/gcloud@master
  env:
    PROJECT_ID: test
    APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS }}
  with:
    args: cp your-file.txt gs://your-bucket/
    cli: gsutil
```

### Secrets

`APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - To authorize in GCP you need to have a [service account key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey). 
You can also pass a base64 encoded string. To encode a JSON file use: `base64 ~/<account_id>.json`. 

`PROJECT_ID` - must be provided to activate a specific project.

### Inputs

`args` - command to run.

`cli` - (optional) command line tool you want to use. Defaults to `gcloud`, allowed values: `gcloud`, `gsutil`.

### Version
For each new release of gcloud master branch is updated to the latest version. Also, the tag is creating with the same number as the gcloud version. If you want to always have the latest version of gcloud, use `@master` branch. 
But if you need some specific version of gcloud just use a specific tag. For example `@271.0.0`.
